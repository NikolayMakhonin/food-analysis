Most,0.003864048

he nodded,0.003639971
I told him,0.003638261

I see,0.003633129

He shrugged,0.001518935
about that,0.001515514
he told,0.001515514
her hand,0.001512093
instead of,0.001512093

Upon,0.001380384
He looked at,0.001380384
Sam,0.001376963
A moment later,0.001375252

That's the,0.001317095
